# nodeMysql

## Overview

nodeMysql is an application that displays a table of products then prompts the user to choose an item and the quantity they wish to purchase. The user is then shown the product details and the total cost of the purchase.

You can use nodeMysql to purchase items that are stored in the database.

## How to use:

To get started open the nodeMysql depository in your bash/terminal.
Type "Node bamazonCustomers.js". A table with all of the currently posted items will be displayed.
Pick an Item-Number and the quantity you'd like to purchase.
